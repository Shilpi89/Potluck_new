Potluck Event Application

Heroku link: http://potluck-app.herokuapp.com

Potluck is a meal to which each guest contributes food. This is an event where a particular date is decided and associates from the ODC participate by getting various food items, which they sell to raise some amount for any charity trust.

In my application one can create/edit such Potluck events. Likewise, if someone is interested to participate, then they can sign in and add their participation details.
